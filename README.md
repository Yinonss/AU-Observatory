<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project we developed a web planner for astronomical research for the new observatory facility in Ariel University.

### What is a planner?
Planner is an interface which allows the researcher to create and edit an astronomical studies. The astronomer
can specify the target, the research date and determine the imaging sessions.
The planner then transform the astronomer request into a set of instruction that the robotic observatory will be
able to perform. But not all requests are legal. When set an illogical request or chose two setting that conflicting
with each other - the planner won't except the plan.

### Motivation
The researchers from the Astrophysics department in our university are using observatory control system which called
ACP. This program has a local desktop planner with old and complicated design . 

### Goal
Our mission was to create an accessible web interface which will be much more intuitive, comely and comfortable
in order to provide a great user experince. This planner will produce an ACP script file which operate the facility.

## Utilized
